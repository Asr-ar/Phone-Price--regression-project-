## Introduction

With	the	technological	development	that	mobile	phones	have	become	a	
necessity	for	the	majority	of	people.

With	the	different	manufacturers	of	these	phones,	the	characteristics	of	the	
phones	differ	from	one	company	to	another,	from	the	most	common	
characteristics	can	be	considered	the	touch	screen	feature,	water	protection,	
memory	capacity,	photographic	and	video	quality,	and	much	more.

This	project	aims	to	build	a	linear	regression	model	on	the	characteristics
and	the	types	of	the	mobile	phones,	As	the	model	aims	to	predict	the	prices	
of the phones	in	the	future	based	on	the	most	important	characteristics	that	
affect	its	value	in	the	market.

## Problem statement

Can this	model	really	predict	mobile	phone	prices?

Based	on	specific	phones	features?
